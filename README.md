ARVE
====

Ansible ready Vagrant environment.

#Goals:#
* Have an up and running Ansible managed environment set in minimum time with maximum flexibility and productivity.

#Why ARVE?#
* No more setting up ansible/hosts files and copping ssh keys every time you want to try a new stack or write a new role.
Fill your wishlist with your desired VMs and their properties, run Vagrant up and you are good to go.
